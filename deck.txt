% node-vasync
% Observable Asynchronous Control Flow

* Written by Dave Pacheco (Joyent)
      ~davepacheco/node-vasync~ on github

* Similar in concept to ~caolan/async~, but with a focus
    on observability

* Returns status objects updated as flow progresses that
    can be inspected in core files, or exported via web
    services or REPLs

* Provides the ~barrier()~ primitive: specify some set of
    named operations (you can extend the set mid-flight)
    and get a ~drain~ event when they all complete

% Kang
% Distributed System Observability

* Written by Dave Pacheco (Joyent)
      ~davepacheco/kang~ on github

* A library for exposing self-describing state from
    a set of processes via a web service

* A client library and command-line tool for collecting,
    aggregating and inspecting that state

* The exposed state is a set of ~"objects"~ arranged by
    ~"type"~, formatted as a JSON payload
